# web scraper using Node and Puppeteer

A web scraper using Node and Puppeteer. The aim is to scrape the imdb website to get newest movies and details. 
I am well aware it exists an open api for imdb, which might be easier to use in your project. 
This is just for the sake of learning Puppeteer and having fun!
